# GitHub action for nbgv.sh

[Nbgv.sh][nbgv.sh] is a tool that provides semver-compatible versioning for any
project in a git repository. This GitHub action provides simplified access to
nbgv.sh.

## Example


```yaml
# .github/workflows/tag.yml
name: tag
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  tag:
    permissions:
      contents: write  # Note 1
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: '0'  # Note 2
      - run: |
          git config user.name "GitHub Actions"
          git config user.email "actions@github.com"
      - uses: Stefansm/nbgv.sh-action@main
        id: version
      - run: |
          git tag v${{ steps.version.outputs.version }}
      - run: |
          git push --tags
```

There are a few things to note here:

1. The `contents: write` permission is required to push tags to a GitHub
   repository and might not be necessary for your usage.

2. By default, the `checkout@v3` action will check out a single commit, which
   is not sufficient for `nbgv.sh` to work correctly. Setting `fetch-depth: '0'`
   means the action will download the full history.

The action provides a single output: `version`, which contains the version
generated by `nbgv.sh`.
